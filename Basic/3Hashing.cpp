//we can declre int arr size upto 10^6 (arr[10^6]) in the main and 10^7 in the global
//we can declre bool arr size upto 10^7 (arr[10^7]) in the main and 10^8 in the global

//so for large no. we can use map
//TC of ordered map for fetching and storing is O(logn)
//TC of unordered map for fetching and storing is O(1) (avg) but worst is O(n) because of collision

//Division method -> chaining ->collision
//folding method
//mid square method
