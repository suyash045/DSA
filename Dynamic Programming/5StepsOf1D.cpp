//Mostly in 1D questions we have to count the no. of ways or the best way(min or max condition)
//All recursive problems are 1D problems

// Steps
// 1) Try to represent the problem in terms of index.
// 2) Do all possible stuffs on that index.
// 3) Sum of all stuffs -> Count all ways
//    min(of all stuffs) -> find min
